<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Create and manage lists

.DESCRIPTION
    GET lists/subscribers/show
    
    Check if the specified user is a subscriber of the specified list. Returns the user if they are a subscriber.

.PARAMETER owner_screen_name
    The screen name of the user who owns the list being requested by a slug.

.PARAMETER owner_id
    The user ID of the user who owns the list being requested by a slug.

.PARAMETER list_id
    The numerical id of the list.

.PARAMETER slug
    You can identify a list by its slug instead of its numerical id. If you decide to do so, note that you'll also have to specify the list owner using the owner_id or owner_screen_name parameters.

.PARAMETER user_id
    The ID of the user for whom to return results. Helpful for disambiguating when a valid user ID is also a valid screen name.

.PARAMETER screen_name
    The screen name of the user for whom to return results. Helpful for disambiguating when a valid screen name is also a user ID.

.PARAMETER include_entities
    When set to either true, t or 1, each Tweet will include a node called "entities". This node offers a variety of metadata about the tweet in a discreet structure, including: user_mentions, urls, and hashtags. While entities are opt-in on timelines at present, they will be made a default component of output in the future. See Tweet Entities for more details.

.PARAMETER skip_status
    When set to either true , t or 1 statuses will not be included in the returned user objects.
